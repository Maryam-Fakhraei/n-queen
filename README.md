# n-queen
N - Queens problem is to place n - queens in such a manner on an n x n chessboard that no queens Do not be threatened. 
We need to check if there exists such an arrangement of n queens and if it exists then print the arrangement.
Rule
According to the rules of chess, this is equivalent to the requirement that no two queens be on the same row or the same column or on a common diagonal.
Note
for n =1, the problem has a trivial solution, and no solution exists for n =2 and n =3.
